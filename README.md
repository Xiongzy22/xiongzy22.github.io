### About me
Hello, I'm Zhiyao Xiong, just a lover of mathmatics. I am quite interested in exploring some wonderful results in complicated things with a analytical approach. Specifically, I am now learning geometric analysis. I am also a lover of piano, football and tennis.

### Seminars

* (2022Autumn) [Here](notes/Ricci_flow/Ricci_flow.pdf) are the lecture notes I typed for a seminar about Ricci flow and the sphere theorem.
* (2022Spring) [Here](notes/Conformal/Conformal.pdf) are the lecture notes I typed for a seminar about conformal geometry.

### Personal notes

* [Here](notes/Foundation_of_analysis/Foundations.pdf) are my notes about the foundations of analysis, which contain some basic knowledge about functional analysis and real analysis.
